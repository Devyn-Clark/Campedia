<h2>Hydration</h2>
<h3>What to look for when purchasing</h3>
<ul>
<li>When being away from civilization for so long is an essential part of the camping trip, keeping
yourself hydrated is a must.
</li>

<li>According to the NOLS.edu blog, campers should have at least 4-5 liters of water a day.</li>
<li>Hydration Packs are used for people that don't wish to stop what they're doing while keeping
hydrated, all you have to do is take a sip from your Drink Tube that is connected to your Hydration Bladder.
</li>

<li>When looking for a Hydration Pack, you should be looking at its size. Most Bladders are Two-Liters to
three liters, with smaller ones being one liter. Three-Liter Bladders, while the most expensive, provide
you with 50% more water than one or Two-Liters.
</li>

<li>You can choose your Bladder's opening based on your own level of comfort.
Fold Tops flip up and fold over, once folded over you have to slid a folder over the top to prevent leaks.
Zip Top Bladder's have functions comparable to your ordinary zip lock bag, but are considered by some to be 
harder to close then fold tops.
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Common Hydration Mistakes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not cleaning your Hydration Bladder can lead to various forms of infection, making a hazard of any water you would
put in it.
On that note, getting things like dirt on your Bladder can lead to it being easily stained.
</li>
</ul>
