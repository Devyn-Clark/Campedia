<h2>Storage</h2>
<h3>What To do</h3>
<ul>
<li>While camping materials like flashlights are easily packed into your backpack, your tents, and your 
other pieces of furniture will be a far tighter fit. As a rule of thumb, you should always keep your equipment
in a cool and dry setting.
</li>

<li>While you don't necessarily need to purchase anything for storage, you can find perfectly functional
storage bins on websites like Amazon. If you are going to use such containers, it would be imperative to
label them so as to not lose track of what they're holding.
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Common Storage Mistakes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Placing your materials in a warm environment could lead to them being damaged by the heat.</li>

<li>Just jamming anything you can into boxes might seem like an effective way to save time, but it will
often lead to confusion when it comes time to unpack everything once again.
</li>
