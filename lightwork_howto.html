<h2>Lightwork</h2>

<h3>What to look for when purchasing</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should be looking to buy multiple light sources for different scenarios, a basic lantern would do for lighting
large areas while a handlamp would be appropriate for setting up a tent in the dark. Spotlight can be used for searching through
dark areas with a more concentrated beam of light. A head torch can free up your hands while still providing a good source of light.
</li>

<li>You should also be wary of what type of bulbs you purchase. Incandescent bulbs reach full brightness immediately 
and can provide steady, non-flickering streams of light. Flourescent bulbs tend to be far more durable but also larger than most types of light bulb.
LED bulbs use very little electricity and generate minimal amounts of heat.
</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Common Lightwork Mistakes</h3>
<ul>
<li>While LED lights are a powerful and popular tool, there are certain brands that are not dimmable, meaning they
stay the same intensity regardless of the time of day. In addition, you should make sure the dimmers are of good quality
or you could risk having your lights flicker when they reach a lower intensity.
</li>
</ul>

<div>
<h3>How to use lightwork effectively</h3>
<ul>
<li>You need to make sure you choose the lights you use based on your needs, take into account the bulbs your items use.
Purchase efficient lights while keeping your budget in mind.
