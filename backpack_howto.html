<h2>Backpack</h2>
<h3>What to look for in a purchase</h3>
<ul>
<li>When purchasing a backpack for your camping trip, the amount
of things your pack can hold is an obvious key issue. Most backpacks
have their capacity measured by way of liters; they can range
from 35 to 75 liters. How large a pack you should purchase is dependent on how long your trip will be.
The materials the bag is made of is also important. An ideal pack would need a strong strength to weight
ratio. Popular materials would include, nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and canvas.
</li>
</ul>
