<h2>Sleeping Gear</h2>
<h3>What To Look For When Purchasing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sleeping Bags are rated based on two principles: temperature and seasons.
Two-Season sleeping bags are used for Summer and the warmer parts of Spring and Fall and are rated for 
32 degrees or above.
</li>

<li>Three-Season bags are rated for 20 degrees and are used for camping in Spring and Fall.</li>
<li>Four-Season bags are used for Winter and are suitable for 15 degrees or below.</li>
<li>Sleeping bags have three temperature ratings: comfort, limit, and extreme.</li>

<li>Comfort is the ideal level for a sleeping bag.
Limit is the lowest temperature level and is judged by the average temperature level that an adult male can 
sleep at night. This level will often lead to you feeling cold upon waking up.
Extreme temperature level is the last level and is the absolute level used for survival situations. It will 
keep a person alive in hypothermic temperatures for six hours.
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Common Sleeping Bag Mistakes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finding a sleeping bag that doesn't fit your size and shape.</li>

<li>Taking your temperature ratings as gospel is also a mistake as they don't perfectly reflect
real life scenarios since they are done in laboratory scenarios.
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Using Your Sleeping Gear Effectively</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider the environment your going to be sleeping in and make sure you buy a sleeping bag
of an appropriate comfort level.
</li>
<li>Make sure you buy a bag that can weather your perfered camping seasons.</li>
<li>Make sure you have a bag that can fit your frame. Measure yourself and select a bag going 
off of those measurements. Mummy sleeping bags are usually a far tighter fit, while Rectangular bags can provide a fair level 
of comfort for your arms and legs.
</li>
</ul>
