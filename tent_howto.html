 <h2>Tent</h2> 
<h3>What To Look For In A Purchase</h3>
<ul>
<li>When purchasing a tent, it is important that you think of what would best suit your needs.
How many people are going to be in your tent is the first and most obvious one and can become more complicated than you'd think.
While a four person tent might sit four, fitting the width of four people lying down to sleep might not be possible. Another issue would be your camping environment,
a Summer tent is too lightweight and open-vented to be taken out the middle of Winter. A Three-Season tent might be useful with some harsh
environments but is useless in snow.</li>

<li>When considering the size of your tent, you should factor in the qualities of yourself and other occupants like height, sleeping habits, and 
clausrophobia.</li>

<li>Whatever your choice, you need to consider the type of camper you are and plan ahead from there.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Tent Mistakes</h3>
<ul>
<li>=When finding a place to pitch your tent you need to take into account the fragility of its floor. In doing so, you need to make 
sure there are no rocks or roots underneath that could pierce through it. When pitching near sources of water, you would need to be
at least 200 feet away to prevent wear and tear from the liquid.</li>

<li>Where you set your tent should also factor in the temperature. While setting up your tent in direct sunlight sounds like a good idea
for cold nights, the sun's rays could pontentially damage the fabrics beyond the point of further use.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>To maximize space in the tent you should take all of your belongings out of the sleeping area and into another compartment. In addition,
make sure you keep them away from tent walls to prevent them from being damaged by condensation. Piling them on top of each other would be your best option. </li>


<li>To properly set up a tent, you'd need two or more people to stretch it out before staking it on opposite corners. 
The stakes must be driven straight down with the hook facing out and be pounded down entirely. Unfold the pole segments and then insert
 the main one into the sleeves outside the tent and repeat with the other poles. From there, drape the Rainfly over your tent and
fasten it along the edges before finally raising the tent.</li>
